<b>Simple Ringtone Changer App</b><br>
<br>
A simple ringtone changer app that doesn't require an internet connection. You can select any local folder containing audio files and set them as your ringtone, notification, or alarm sound.

Due to Android's security restrictions, the app requires the "Modify system settings" permission to change ringtone settings. You can revoke this permission at any time or uninstall the app without losing your current ringtone selections.

Compatible with Android 9 (API level 28) or higher.
