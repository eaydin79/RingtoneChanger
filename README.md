Simple ringtone changer app which doesn't require internet connection, you can choose any local folder contains audio files and set them as ringtone, notification or alarm sounds.

Because of android security restrictions, the app needs "Modify system settings" permission to change ringtone settings. Users can revoke the permission anytime even uninstall the app without losing ringtone changes
